Project Title: "No Hunger Initiative" 

Brief Problem Statement: 
Large quantities of food are often wasted at social events, weddings, and corporate gatherings. Meanwhile, many people in nearby communities go hungry due to lack of access to nutritious meals. This project aims to create a system that collects leftover food from events and redistributes it safely and efficiently to those in need through partnerships with NGOs, shelters, and volunteers.

Core Idea: 
  *Identify events with surplus food. 
  *Coordinate with organizers for timely pickup. 
  *Ensure food safety during transport and storage. 
  *Distribute food to nearby shelters, orphanages, or low-income communities.

  2. Stakeholder Engagement
     *Connect with event organizers, caterers, and venues.
     *Create awareness about food donation benefits and safety.

     *Include features for food quantity estimation and safety checks.
  4. Logistics Setup

     *Train volunteers on food handling and hygiene.
     *Set up temporary storage points if needed.
  5. Food Collection & Distribution

     *Collect feedback from donors and recipients.
     *Use data to improve efficiency and impact.
  7. Promotion & Expansion
